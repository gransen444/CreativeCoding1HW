\f0\fs24 \cf0 A Command Line Interface is a method of programming that utilizes text commands to control software. A Graphical User Interface uses graphical elements to represent functions of its system. GUI is more user friendly, and is commonly used in day to day life. CLI however, is more malleable- there are infinite possibilities with the right commands. }
